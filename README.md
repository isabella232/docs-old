# docs

This repo contains readable documentation about various tools, features, and concepts in Libp2p. In the future, we hope to turn it into an actual documentation website that collects documentation and information from across all the Libp2p projects and repos.


## Contributing Content

We’d like to include several kinds of content here, including:

1. **Introductory overview.** A clear, understandable introduction to Libp2p’s overall ideas and usage.

2. **Concepts.** Libp2p includes a lot of new concepts around addressing, networking, and data sharing. Concept docs provide a high-level overview of these.

2. **Guides, examples, and tutorials.** Most examples currently live in other repos. If you have thoughts on how to better integrate them, please file an issue here!

If you’d like to write some of these docs, we’d absolutely love your help! ❤️ Please [post an issue](https://github.com/libp2p/docs/issues/new) describing what you plan to document and a general overview or outline so folks know what you’re working on, and once you have decent draft, submit a PR!
