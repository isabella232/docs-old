# Libp2p Concepts

Concept docs are concise, high-level descriptions of various core concepts in Libp2p. Some might represent specific technologies that also have [*specifications*](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/), but these concept docs are meant to focus on the high-level ideas and usage as opposed to specific technical details.


## Writing Concept Docs

Concept docs should strive to answer:

1. **What** is this?
2. How does it **relate** to the rest of Libp2p?
3. How can (or should?) you **use** it? (Note: sometimes the answer is that you should understand it, but *not* use it. *Bitswap* is probably a good example.)
4. **Where** do you go to learn more?
5. What is the **current state** of affairs?
